# Coding Challenges
An assortment of small Python coding problems and my solutions to them. Each problem has its own directory which contains the instructions for the problem in `instructions.md` and my solutions to it in a ``.py`` file. In some cases, a clearly-named Python unit test file may also be included.

Some solutions require external dependencies; those dependencies are listed in ``pyproject.toml``. Because these coding problems are small, dependencies are not isloated on a per-problem basis; there is only one set of dependecies for the entire repository.

Unless otherwise noted in `instructions.md`, challenges are sourced from [Daily Coding Problem](https://dailycodingproblem.com).
